What are Comments?
            Text in code that explains what it does.
            Python ignores comments during execution - they're for humans reading the code.
            ​
Types of Comments
1. Single Line Comment
Starts with #, goes till end of line.

example:=>
         # This is a single line comment
         print("Hello")  # Inline comment - explains this line
2. Multi-line Comment
         Use separate # on each line, or triple quotes """ """:
example:=>>
         """
         This is a multi-line comment
         spanning 3 lines
         Easy for blocks of text
         """
         print("World")
